Are we okay with turning all existing commands to the new slash command style?

I'm planning on redoing some things in a more modern style. For example, Sid suggested that the react roles be re-done to use the new buttons instead. Regarding new discord API features like these, do you have any specific requests or input?

What are the most important features for the bot currently? I'd like to prioritize those first.

Are you okay with me removing unused commands and various meme relating things, just in the name of general house-keeping? If so, do you have suggestions for things that you'd like to remove? Anything you'd like me to specifically not remove?

Since the bot is being re-done from the ground up, its probably worth mentioning the hosting situation. The bot has always been hosted on my VPS, which I absolutely do not mind. I'm paying for it either way, and I have plenty of horsepower to run it. But, I figured it would be polite to double check with you, and make sure everyone is still comfortable with that.

I'm thinking about creating a new admin interface for the bot so that you all can access it online to make changes on the fly (like adjusting some commands or parameters or sending messages). Is that something that would be useful enough to implement?

Do you have any input for bot?

Discuss timeline - I'm developing the bot as I go, but if you need any immediate bot updates I can still edit the current one any time.
